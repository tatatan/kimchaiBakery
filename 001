# in my opinion "Tea" "Coffee" "Hot Chocolate" may should be forecasted too :)

# according to this list coffee can last superlong (compare with pastry) but if it is latte????
# maybe we forecast just for fun ## to be discussed with Kim


#check for duplicated item

#we found that there is 1380 duplicated item
# but from the data transaction shown, we assume it can be count as "double portion" or like 2 customers come together:D
